# LoRa-Based 4-Channel Relay Control Board (Altium Designer)

## Overview  
This project presents a **custom PCB design** for a **4-channel relay control system** based on the **ESP32-C3** and **LoRa RA-02** module.  
The board enables **remote control of actuators** over long distances using **LoRa communication**, making it ideal for **IoT and automation applications** such as **smart agriculture, remote monitoring, and industrial control**.

It includes a **battery management and power regulation system** using:  
- **BQ24040DSQR** for **Li-Ion battery charging**  
- **TPS61230DRCR** for **voltage boosting**  
- **TPS7A9201DSKR** for **low-noise voltage regulation**  

Designed entirely with **Altium Designer**, this board offers **robust connectivity**, **efficient power management**, and **multi-channel actuation capability**.
